# BINARY SEGMENTATION USING PYTORCH
This folder contains the code for the training and inference of models for checking if the selected plates contains a growth in the border of the filter (internal and external).
### Original repo here
https://github.com/qubvel-org/segmentation_models.pytorch
### How to use it and install the dependencies
Dependencies are handled by poetry. Install everything inside your environment using:\
``pip install poetry``\
and then run\
``poetry install``\
The current code for training and inference is configured for Python 3.11 and CUDA 12.6. Therefore, you may need to update these requirements to match your system configuration. (TODO)
